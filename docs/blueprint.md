# **App Name**: Timeline Ace

## Core Features:

- Scrollable Timeline Grid: Display a scrollable timeline grid, with services as column headers and time as rows.  The service column headers will remain fixed while the timeline scrolls vertically.
- Service Header Editor: Allow editing of service headers to rename the service (e.g., abbreviate names using emojis).
- Touch-Based Event Input: Enable adding events to the timeline cells by tapping. A modal or inline editor appears to enter details.
- AI-Powered Event Highlighting: Use an LLM-powered tool that reasons about the relevance of newly entered event data and automatically highlight or categorize it (e.g., 'critical milestone,' 'potential issue').
- Event Display: Display events within each timeline cell. Different event types can be color-coded.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 65%, 50% (RGB hex: #3399CC) for a professional and calming feel. A dependable blue represents project tracking and focus.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (RGB hex: #F0F5F7), a light, desaturated blue that is easy on the eyes for extended use.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 55%, 50% (RGB hex: #4DBDBD), an analogous teal hue providing clear contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text due to its modern and neutral appearance.
- Use minimalist, consistent icons for different event types to allow easy recognition.
- Ensure the timeline grid is responsive across devices, and the service column headers are fixed during vertical scrolling.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during user interactions (e.g., tapping a cell, saving data).
